Python :
*Python is an Interpreted, object-oriented, high-level progaming language and dynamically typed.
*It can be used to create *web applications
                          *software development
                          *mathematical operation 

What can python do :
*Python can be used on a server side to create web application.
*Python can be used to handle big data and complexe medhematics.
*Python can connect to database system, it can also read modify Files.

Why python :
*Python works on differnt platforms (windows, mac, linser, Reasbery pi").
*Python has a simple Pyntax Brimilar to the English Language,that allows developes to write programs a with fewer lines.
*Python run on an interpreter system, meaning that code can br executed line by line as soon as it is written.

Syntax :
*the system of rules for the structure of sentence.

Indentation :
*Indentation refers to the spaces at the begiimming of a code line.
*Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Comment #:
*Cmments can be used to explain python code.

Mmultiline comment """___""" :
*Write a multiple comment line.

Doc-string """______________________________
______________________________""" :
*It is used as multiline strints in variable.

Variable:
*Variables are container for storing data values.

Rules for python variable :
--Dan't :
*case-sensitive
*0-9 start with num
*keywords
*name(space)name
*my-name
*my@nmae
--Do's :
*myvar2
*my_var
*_myname
*myname

global variable:
variable that are created outside of a fonction #global variable can be used by anywhen both inside of function and outside

local variable:
it can global only be used inside of the function keword if u want global variable inside of the dune Hon = Create

use global keyb def mame() y word to create the variable

Syntax : global
X = "Hello wellcome print(s)

name

data types:-





Type cauffing!- (or) constructor Sonition

carting in python therefore done using constructor Rome tioms *int ("), float (), str(), list(), teplel), set (), dict()

slicing shing: specify shout Pindere and end indesc, separated by colem,

Yange of String [25]

slice from start a [:5]

slice to end

a2 J

neg indese a[-5:-2]




string concatenation: To concatenate, or combine two things you can = use the + operator

string formating: the format() method takes the passed argument, = formate them, and places them in the shing where the place holders & Z

Syntare: fact = "" A my name is { } from { }; format Gooty print (dex)





amlator: & the process of converting programming Biretruction in form of Binary instruction is called as translation & the Device used for translation is called as Transtafor

pe of translator::

* compier

Interpreter






Compiten: it is a transtator which will convert the entire code at once in form of binary instructions

Intepreter: it is a translator which will convent the line by line instruction in form of binary instruction






ywords six these are universal standard words, whose Task in pre-defined by the developer....

* we can access the keywords, but we cannot modify the original task

amically typed python is a dynamically tyled language" which means that you don't have to specify the data type of a variable when we declare







python library : xit is a collection of related modules, it contin bundles of code

* it is pre-defined by the developer

* it is easy to coccess, but we cannot modify it's predefined taile

ex: import math, pandas, mampages, matplotlib







List: list are used to store multiple items in a single variable Bn used to store collections of data, it is Indexed *Blyth Ban sented by [3 * list is represented

* list is ordered

* list is mutable

* list is Heterogeneous list contains duplicate



Tople • #Tuple are used to store multiple items in a (ingl erialate * python used to store collections of data, it is indexed

tuple is represented by ()

& tuple is ordered

* tuple. is immutable

tuple is Heterogeneous

*it contains duplicate





set: python used to store collection of data, it is unindend * it it represented by { }

* Jet is unordered

a set is immutable

* set is Heterogeneous

* it is doesnt allows duplicate items









dict dictionary consist of a collection of key and values pairs

* dictionary is represented by { } and key: valves * dict is heterogeneol

Idict "key" is unique and "value" in doplicated

> dict is ordered

* dict is mutable

Openators: operators are used to perform operations on variable

and values

Arithmetic operators

* Assignment operators

* Comparison operators (or) Relational operators

* logical operators

R 1 Identity Operators

* Membership operators

* Bitwise operators
